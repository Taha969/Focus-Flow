## Focus Flow 🎯

This is my final project for the Harvard University CS50 course 👇 .

What is "Focus Flow"? 🎯 It acts as a "personal bodyguard" for your focus while you work on your computer. It is a Chrome Extension designed to prevent you from wasting time.

The Problem It Solves: We all fall into the same trap: You are working hard, and then you tell yourself, "I'll just take a quick look at Facebook or YouTube." Suddenly, an hour has passed, and you haven't accomplished anything!

**How Does "Focus Flow" Solve This? (The Concept) This project places a "temporary lock" on the websites that distract you.**

1. You are in charge: You select the "banned" websites (e.g., youtube.com, facebook.com).

2. Set the time: You choose a duration for deep focus (e.g., 30 minutes).

3. Start working: Once you click the "Start" button, the timer begins.

What happens if you try to cheat? 🚫 If you try to open YouTube or Facebook while the timer is running, the extension will immediately close the page and display a red screen telling you: "No! Focus on your work now!"

**Practical Example: Imagine you have an important exam or project:**

1. Open Focus Flow.

2. Type in the list: tiktok.com, instagram.com.

3. Set the timer to 45 minutes.

4. Click Start.

Now, for 45 minutes, your device is "immune" to TikTok and Instagram. Even if your willpower fades and you try to visit them, the extension will stop you. Once the 45 minutes are up, everything returns to normal.
